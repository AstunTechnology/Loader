# details if you are writing to PostGIS).

# Example of using PGDump format which will create SQL files
# ready to load via psql.
#
# The chosen options assume that the tables already exist,
# COPY is used in favor of INSERT statements and no attempt
# is made to create a spatial index for improved load performance.
#
# *Notes*
#
# If you want to avoid (no fatal) error messages when loading the
# SQL dump files then you need OGR >= 1.8.1 in order to use the
# create_schema layer creation option (-lco create_schema=off).
#
# There is a known issue with OGR 1.8 related to loading single features into
# a geometry column of type MULTI. The issue is fixed in OGR 1.9.
#
# The path /path/to/output/ needs to be set to the directory
# that the SQL dump files should be written to.
